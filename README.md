Splockets
=========

Read a subset of Sprockets directives to concatenate your JavaScript to stdout.

This was written so that I could concatenate JavaScript files in a Rails app and pass them on to Jasmine for testing, and do so faster than Sprockets could in our existing setup.  It was also an excuse to write something in Node and my first real attempt, so caveat emptor.  But if it's useful to anyone else, great!

The name is a complete rip off of Snockets (https://github.com/TrevorBurnham/snockets).  If you're looking at this project you should probably check out that page since it does some similar and probably much better.
